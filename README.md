# Diagnosability

We show how to encode bounded diagnosability problem (critical pair as a counterexample, please see the paper DiagnosabilityDES.pdf) for finite automata in smt with the files available here, which are only for a very simple example stored in model.txt. This simple system contains six events, where three observable events are represented by integers 1-3 and two unobservable normal events by 4-5 and one unobservable faulty event by 6. There are eight transitions in this system that one can find in the file model.txt beginning from line 2 (one transition per line). The file diagWithQuantifier.smt contains the smt formula simplified from that is presented in the paper DiagnosabilitySMTtimedAutomata.pdf, the latter is for timed automata. The file diagNoQuantifier.smt is a quantifier-free version for the same example. And result.txt contains a model satisfying the smt formula, i.e., a critical pair which is a pair of trajectories of the system where only one of them contains the fault while both of them have the same observations.

The next step is to make available a python package that generates automatically smt formula for this problem with different parameters for any given system (finite automata or timed automata). The automatic generation of big systems (benchmarks) will also be provided by this package.
